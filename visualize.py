'''
gonna try out some pygame here to visualize the environment
ill have a fixed window size and show:
    factories and pile
    your board
    other state variables

player can interact step by step by provided all parts to a move
will prob not do a point and click thingie as my goal is not to make Azul
just want something to manually test and be there for testing visualizations
